# Order Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves an end-to-end analysis of order data for a shop. The analysis is performed using a combination of Python for data cleaning and ETL processes, and MS SQL for detailed data analysis and answering ad hoc questions. The goal is to gain insights into the shop's order data to help improve business decisions.

## Features
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) using Pandas and NumPy.
- Data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Detailed data analysis using SQL queries in MS SQL.
- Answering ad hoc questions based on order data.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive Python development and visualization.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**:
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **SQL**:
  - **MS SQL**: For data analysis and querying.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and documenting the Python code.


## Usage
1. **Data Cleaning and ETL Process**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`orders_cleaning.ipynb`).
   - Run the cells to perform data extraction, transformation, and loading.
   - The cleaned data will be saved to a specified location or directly loaded into the database.

2. **Data Analysis and SQL Queries**:
   - Use the SQL scripts provided in the `Order_analysis` file to perform various analyses.
   - Modify the queries as needed to answer specific questions about the order data.
